## Project Description
This is a freeCodeCamp project I picked to expand my knowledge and skills. Any feedback you would give will be well received.

### What this project do?
I've expanded beyond the tutorial. So far these are the actions that can be accomplished.

- Create a Book
  - Serialize the Book's cover image (Frontend).
  - Deserialize the Book's cover image (Backend).
  - Directory creation to save the new Book's cover image.
- Update an existing Book
  - Same image serialization and directory manipulation processes.
- Delete an existing Book
  - Delete Book's cover image and corresponding directory.
- Read Book data
  - Image serialization (Backend).
  - Show Books by category (Frontend).
